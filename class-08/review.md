Functions

YOu have to declare a function and you have to invoke a function for it to run

Variables scoped within the function (local scope) are only avaliable within the function

Variables can be passed into a function.  YOu can also pass other functions as an argument

Functions have parameters that take the arguments passed by the function invoke

function doAthing(thing){ <-Parameter
    does a thing
}

doAthing(thing); <- Argument

Write a function in various ways and passing the same information in differnet ways.
